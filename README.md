Hello,

my name is Renaud Bresson and I am currently in training to become a Web Developer.
I am passionate about exploring new technologies and solving complex problems, I have always had a strong interest in the power of the internet to connect people and ideas, and I am excited to learn more about how to build functional and user-friendly websites. 
My goal is to develop the skills and knowledge needed to create dynamic web applications that can have a positive impact on people's lives.  

Thx

R Bresson
